## Step 1: Environment Setup

Before you start writing any code, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the essential tools:

1.  **Code Editor:**
    *   This is where you'll write your code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Recommendation:** [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - It's free, powerful, widely used, and has a vast extension marketplace.
    *   *Alternatives:* Sublime Text, Atom, WebStorm (paid).

2.  **Web Browser:**
    *   You need a modern web browser to view your web pages and test your code.
    *   **Recommendations:** [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/).
    *   **Key Feature:** Learn to use the built-in **Developer Tools** (usually opened by pressing `F12`). They are crucial for inspecting HTML, debugging CSS, and analyzing JavaScript.

3.  **Version Control System (Git):**
    *   Git is essential for tracking changes in your code over time. It allows you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and manage different features.
    *   **Installation:** Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
    *   **Hosting:** Create an account on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to host your repositories remotely (for backup and collaboration). We'll primarily use GitHub in this guide.

4.  **Node.js and npm (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment. While not strictly required for *basic* HTML/CSS, it's fundamental for *modern* web development. It's used for build tools, package management, running servers, and much more.
    *   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js. It's used to install third-party packages (libraries, frameworks, tools).
    *   **Installation:** Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version from https://nodejs.org/. The LTS version is recommended for most users due to its stability.
    *   *Verification:* After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run `node -v` and `npm -v`. You should see the installed version numbers printed.

Once you have these tools installed and verified, you're ready to move on to the next step!
